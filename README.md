# fyneexperiments

Some experiments to see if the Fyne toolkit suits my needs.

Things I need:

* Ability to resize table columns
* Ability to color whole table rows, either by setting the background color or the text color
* Ability to add controls to sort tables by column
* Right-click context menus
